# Understanding Vidking.net Console Errors

## Summary

Most console errors you see with Vidking.net are **NORMAL** and don't affect video playback. The player is designed to try multiple servers and handle failures gracefully.

---

## ‚úÖ SAFE ERRORS (Ignore These)

### 1. ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT

```
POST https://inkraduellos.qpon/cuid/?f=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vidking.net net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT
GET https://static.cloudflareinsights.com/beacon.min.js/... net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT
```

**What it means**: Your ad blocker is blocking tracking/analytics scripts

**Impact**: ‚úÖ NONE - These are just tracking scripts, video playback is NOT affected

**Action**: Ignore - this is actually good (privacy protection)

---

### 2. Server Fallback Messages

```
Trying Helium server for TV show 119051, S1E1...
Trying Oxygen server for TV show 119051, S1E1...
```

**What it means**: Vidking.net tries multiple streaming servers to find working sources

**Impact**: ‚úÖ NONE - This is normal operation

**Action**: Wait - the player will find a working server

---

### 3. WASM/Decryption Errors

```
Error initializing WASM module: TypeError: Failed to fetch
Error decrypting sources: TypeError: Failed to fetch
```

**What it means**:

- Sources not available on current server
- Player is still initializing
- Ad blocker interfering with WASM modules

**Impact**: ‚úÖ NONE if video plays - Player will retry with different servers

**Action**: Wait for player to try other servers

---

### 4. Internal TMDB 404s

```
GET https://db.cineby.app/3/tv/2738253?api_key=... 404 (Not Found)
TV show with ID 2738253 not found.
```

**What it means**: Vidking.net is querying their internal metadata database

**Impact**: ‚úÖ NONE - This is just additional metadata, not the video source

**Action**: Ignore - Your correct TMDB ID is still being used for video

---

## ‚ùå ACTUAL ERRORS (Fix These)

### 1. Invalid TMDB ID in Your Code

```
// In your netflix-content.ts
tmdbId: "999999" // ‚ùå This doesn't exist
```

**What it means**: The TMDB ID in your code doesn't exist

**Impact**: ‚ùå Video won't load

**Action**: Use verified IDs from VERIFIED_TMDB_IDS.md

---

### 2. Wrong Content Type

```
// Movie ID used for series
tmdbId: "512195", // This is a movie
type: "series" // ‚ùå Wrong type
```

**What it means**: Type doesn't match the TMDB ID

**Impact**: ‚ùå Player confusion, wrong metadata

**Action**: Ensure type matches ("movie" or "series")

---

### 3. No Sources Available

```
SettingsOverlay: No qualities received
```

**What it means**: No video sources found on any server

**Impact**: ‚ùå Video won't play

**Action**:

1. Check if TMDB ID is correct
2. Try a different show (some content may not be available)
3. Wait and retry (sources might be temporarily down)

---

## üîç How to Debug

### Step 1: Verify Your TMDB ID

```typescript
// In lib/netflix-content.ts
title: "Squid Game",
tmdbId: "93405", // ‚úÖ Check this at themoviedb.org
type: "series",  // ‚úÖ Must match (series or movie)
```

### Step 2: Check Console for Critical Errors

Look for:

- ‚ùå "TMDB ID ... not found" in YOUR code
- ‚ùå "No sources available" after trying all servers
- ‚úÖ Ignore: ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT, Failed to fetch, server fallback messages

### Step 3: Test Video Playback

1. Click Play
2. Wait 10-15 seconds (servers are trying)
3. Video should load
4. If not, check if the show is available on Vidking.net

## üí° Tips

1. **Don't disable your ad blocker** - ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT errors are harmless
2. **Be patient** - Server fallback takes 5-10 seconds
3. **Console errors are normal** - Focus on whether video actually plays
4. **Check VERIFIED_TMDB_IDS.md** - When adding new content

---

## üÜò Still Having Issues?

If video doesn't play after 15 seconds:

1. ‚úÖ TMDB ID is correct and verified
2. ‚úÖ Type matches (series vs movie)
3. ‚úÖ Wait for server fallback to complete
4. ‚ùå Content might not be available on Vidking.net
5. Try a different show to confirm player works
